# HealthCare-Dashboard-using-PowerBI
This repository contains the complete project files for a HealthCare Dashboard developed using Power BI. The dashboard provides an interactive and data-driven solution for visualizing key healthcare metrics, enabling stakeholders to monitor and analyze patient data, hospital performance, and resource utilization effectively.
Features:
Patient Demographics: Visualize patient demographics, including age, gender, and location, to understand the distribution of healthcare services.
Hospital Performance: Track hospital performance metrics such as admission rates, patient satisfaction scores, and average length of stay.
Resource Utilization: Analyze resource allocation, including bed occupancy rates, staffing levels, and equipment usage.
Interactive Filters: Use dynamic filters to customize views based on specific time periods, departments, or patient categories.
Data Sources: Integrated multiple data sources, including electronic health records (EHR), patient surveys, and hospital administration databases.
Key Insights: Identify trends and patterns that can inform strategic decisions and improve healthcare delivery.
Technologies Used:
Power BI: For creating the interactive dashboard and visualizations.
SQL: For data extraction and querying.
Excel: For initial data cleaning and preparation.
